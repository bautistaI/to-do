PROJECT

This is a simple to-do list which employs javascript and jquery to add to-do items.


Features

After you add to-do items to your list you can click on each item in order to mark them as done. This creates a line-through the text and changes the text to red.
If you click again the item would be delete from the list and from the DOM.
